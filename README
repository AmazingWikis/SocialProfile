This is the readme file for SocialProfile extension.

This is considered SocialProfile Version 2. A lot of features have been gutted out for legal reasons or unused social components. The goal is to split User Activity and User Boards into independent extensions. Further enhancements is planned for the extraction of User Activity and User Boards from SocialProfile.

==Changes Made==
* There originally were 8 extensions integrated, 5 were removed on request. Extensions removed: User Welcome, User Gifts, System Gifts, User Stats, Relationship.
* User Profile and User Activity were gutted for CCPA & GDPR compliance, possibly non-functional dead code exists & requires additional clean up
* DM feature was removed from User Board to avoid CCPA and GDPR legal violations
* Unused social assets were removed
* SQL tables were cleaned up and all patches integrated into sql files
* User Profile fields were adjusted
* User Profile layout was changed to mirror Halopedia's 2 column design
* maintenance scripts were added: dropping all SocialProfile tables, blank a user profile page
